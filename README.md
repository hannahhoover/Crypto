Supply and Future Ambitions

The deflation occurs by burning .5% off every transaction, which not only limits the supply, but incentivises holding it due to the increasing rarity. Another .5% is also sent to the AMWFund, which is a charity to a public school that provides education for underpriveledged communities.

The initial token supply was 2 billion CPC. 1 billion was sent to 0x0 for burning. 0.75 billion was sent to the PancakeSwap liquidity pool, and the other 0.25 billion will be distributed to upcoming exchange liquidity pools. 

Eco-friendly Finance

The goal of this project was to be lightweight and built on a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus protocol. The lightweight nature of the coin ensures that no gas is wasted, and PoS enables the token to have a low impact on the environment, avoid all unnecessary computation, and have high throughput during network congestion.

How to Buy

Using the TrustWallet app (or any Smart Chain wallet), navigate to the DApp: PancakeSwap, and connect your wallet by selecting "Connect".

In the "From" field, select the token you'd like to transfer, then in the "To" field, enter the smart contract for CPC:

If the transaction fails, be sure to incrementally increase the slippage percentage within the PancakeSwap settings. At the time of writing this, 6% is the minimum slippage for a successful transaction.

How to Contribute

The PancakeSwap liquidity pool is what determines the price of CPC. By contributing a combination of both BNB and CPC to the pool, this will allow the exchange enough liquidity to swap between the tokens in higher volumes. Not only is this beneficial to the token by reducing the slippage, but it also gives all contributors rewards in the form of Pancake LPs. When the demand for the token is high, contributors will see high profitability.

To become a liquidity pool contributor, navigate to the "Liquidity" tab in PancakeSwap. Similar to token swapping, paste the contract address for CPC, select the amount of CPC and another token to contribute, then select the "Supply" button.
